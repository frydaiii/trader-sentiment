# Trader Sentiment Overview
- Purpose: Repository just initialized; no source files yet. Awaiting product requirements to define concrete goals (likely sentiment-driven trading tooling per repo name).
- Tech stack: Configured for Python in `.serena/project.yml`. No dependencies or modules committed yet.
- Structure: Only `.serena/project.yml` under `.serena/`. Source, tests, and docs directories still need to be created.
- Next steps: Gather requirements/specs from the user, scaffold Python package layout (e.g., `src/` or `app/`), add dependency management (requirements/poetry/pipenv), and commit initial code.

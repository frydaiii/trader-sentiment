# Task Completion Checklist
1. Run the project's automated tests (plan to use `pytest`) once they exist.
2. Run configured linters/formatters (e.g., `ruff`, `black`) before committing when they are added.
3. Perform any manual verification relevant to the feature (CLI/API check, etc.).
4. Update docs/README and note decisions in commit messages or PR descriptions.
5. Ensure `git status` is clean and push changes for review.

Currently, no automated tooling is configured; revisit this checklist after the initial scaffolding is committed.

# Code Style & Conventions
- Project-specific conventions are not yet defined because there is no code checked in.
- Default to standard Python practices (PEP 8) with type hints for public interfaces and clear, single-responsibility functions.
- Prefer docstrings (Google or Sphinx style) for modules, classes, and complex functions once they exist.
- Keep modules small and cohesive; break out shared helpers into dedicated packages when the project grows.
- Revisit and update this once the team establishes concrete guidelines.
